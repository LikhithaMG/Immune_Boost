    <div id="div1">Immunization</div>
<div id="div2">Immunization, or immunisation, is the process by which an individual's immune system becomes fortified against an infectious agent.Immunization happens in various ways, both in the wild and as done by human efforts in health care. Natural immunity is gained by those organisms whose immune systems succeed in fighting off a previous infection, if the relevant pathogen is one for which immunization is even possible. Natural immunity can have degrees of effectiveness (partial rather than absolute) and may fade over time (within months, years, or decades, depending on the pathogen).Immunizations are often widely stated as less risky and an easier way to become immune to a particular disease than risking a milder form of the disease itself. They are important for both adults and children in that they can protect us from the many diseases out there.</div>
<div id="div3">Negative impacts of not taking Vaccine</div>
<div id="div4"><b>1. Your children will be more likely to get serious illnesses.</b><br>Do you know if children who do not receive complete immunization on time will be susceptible to various vaccine-preventable diseases such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, whooping cough, and diphtheria? Furthermore, children are also susceptible to various other health problems; for example, when a child has measles, complications like diarrhoea, pneumonia, blindness, and malnutrition are common.</div>
<div id="div5"><b>2. Other family members are also more likely to get seriously ill.</b><br>
    Do you know other people around sick and unimmunized children at risk of contracting diseases or vice-versa?
    When you get sick, your children, grandchildren, and parents may be at risk, too
    Adults are the most common source of pertussis (whooping cough) infection in infants, which can be deadly for babies. When your child gets vaccinated, you are protecting yourself and your family, as well as those in your community who may not be able to be vaccinated.  
    <div id="div6"><b>3. You may contribute to a disease outbreak in the community.</b><br>
        Infectious disease cases among a vulnerable group could lead to a broader community outbreak.  This is why the government still vaccinates children against polio. When more children miss their vaccination, diseases that have been in decline for many years could suddenly break out again.</div>
